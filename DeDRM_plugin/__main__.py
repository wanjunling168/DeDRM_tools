"""

NOTE: This code is not functional (yet). I started working on it a while ago
to make a standalone version of the plugins that could work without Calibre, 
too, but for now there's only a rough code structure and no working code yet.

Currently, to use these plugins, you will need to use Calibre. Hopwfully that'll
change in the future.
